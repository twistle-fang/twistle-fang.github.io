## Quart Tart
Campaign: Wendy's

### Personality
Energetic for his age, Quart spends most of his time moving around as he hates staying in one place or being forced to wait for anything. As such, if he can't solve something in a second then he would rather let others deal with it or he will attack it until it disappears. While Quart can be rude to people who inconvenience him, he cares deeply for his allies and can be the best cheering squad as long as his allies aren't doing anything he would consider idiotic or rude. Despite his impatience, Quart can have a solid intuition when it comes to judging other people.

### Description
A quirky man in his late 50's, wearing patched up wizard robes. His hair is peppered black and shaved short, likely to contrast his unkempt and unsightly mangled beard.

In combat, Quart is a valuable asset among his allies. While he can attack with his spells from many feet away, he leans toward the more personal attack methods of caressing his enemies with his powerfully spicy fingers or bashing them in the head with a plastic utensil, preferably a fork but sometimes a spoon. Despite being spell-heavy and almost knocked down multiple times, Quart has taken the role of tanking much of the damage during fights and relies on Reed to haphazardly patch him up to adequacy.

### Wendy's
Though not much has been revealed of his backstory as of yet, Quart Tart seems to be a proud citizen of Freshtovia. He adores the wonderfully fresh-never-frozen food varieties that the nation has to offer and respects the well-crafted weapons that come from the local Snacksmith. He claims to know Reed and Queenie, though, according to Quart, Reed is acting unusual as of late.

Quart drags his friend Reed from the speech area to the Wendy's family-owned restaurant to enjoy the local cuisine, only to discover they aren't serving until a feast later in the day. Much to his dismay Reed seems more interested in breaking into the local Snacksmith than the feast, and Quart is even more appalled when Reed is disappointed in the finest weapons Freshtovia has to offer.

The two eventually decide to visit the gardens to admire the golden statue and spatula and are approached by a shrouded man enlisting their help with the plague in the French Fry Forest. When they set off Quart is about to spill his life story to Reed only to be interrupted by Queenie emerging from the underbrush to join in on the fun.

Though his riddle-solving skills are horrendous in the French Fry Forest, Quart more than proves his worth in combat. Relying on a confused and dejected healer Reed and fighting alongside an ice queen that refuses to use a proper weapon, Quart shines on the battlefield by using his proper weapons and spells that all good Freshtovia wizards are taught to use.

### Relationships
-Queenie: Perhaps an example of opposites attract, the sometimes rude but well-meaning Quart enjoys spending time with the ice queen. While he disapproves of some of her actions, Quart respects Queenie and takes her opinions into consideration during their adventures.

-Reed: Their past relationship is currently not common knowledge, though based on Quart's behavior it seems to have been a decent friendship or alliance. The current relationship is one-sided as Reed cautiously adjusts to Freshtovia and Quart.
