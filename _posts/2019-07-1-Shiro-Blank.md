## Shiro Blank

Campaign: Ronin

### Personality
When not alone with her brother, Shiro is shy and soft-spoken. She only really talks with others when she feels like she needs to and is slow to warm up to others. If it is to or about her brother, Shiro is a nonstop chatterbox and easily displays her intense obsession with him. Because of her loyalty to Sora, she is also loyal to the Ronin clan by association and cares for their wellbeing.

### Description
Shiro is fifteen years old, the youngest member of the group by far, and is physically stunted so she appears even younger. She has long silky hair and wide blue eyes, but most concerning is the fact her proportions are more anime-like than they are realistic. Improperly dressed for the life-threatening adventures the Ronin Clan sends her on, she wears a Japanese middle school uniform with thigh-high socks and a pair of frilly laced panties as a hat. Not built for fighting by any means, Shiro excels at anything technological or mechanical and was often used as a hacker for the group. If forced into a confrontational situation, she would either attempt seduction by preying on the pedophilic men in the dark organizations they infiltrate, or opt to count her blessings and make a run for it in attempts to find help and save her own skin.

### Story
Shiro had no particular motive to join the Ronin Clan. While both Shiro and Sora are orphans, they came upon quite a bit of cash due to undisclosed reasons. Before joining the clan she spent most her days playing videogames and using her hacking abilities to be on the top of the charts for just about every competitive game she sunk her teeth into. When her older brother Sora said he was joining she immediately jumped at the chance to continue being by his side.

### Drifters
Shiro first joined the Ronin Clan with her older brother and assisted in entering the bank by cracking into the security and allowing the rest of the group to pass by undetected. After a failed attempt to sneak behind the AI bank tellers by disguising herself in toilet paper, she rejoined part of the group to enter the club on the upper level and was able to seduce the bodyguard and be let through, much to the disgust of the other party members. After Felicia "went loud" by shooting the steam pipes above the lounge, Shiro focused on hacking into the computer terminal and sending as much information to Overwatch as she could while the others went upstairs. After realizing the Monarch was annihilating her allies, Shiro ran away with Texas to the lower level of the building and then split off when Texas opted to get high as a final hurrah before death. Through sheer luck, Shiro managed to escape the building and run into the Ronan family head Lucille Johnson in a car and direct him to the building to pick up the members of the party that were still alive.

After surviving the bank ordeal Shiro developed intense megalophobia, otherwise known as fear of large things. This is unfortunate, as most things are larger than Shiro. She spent most of the time during the visit with the Koshi family in Miura hiding from larger objects and attempting to dig up evidence in the local library before being dragged to the Koshi family confrontation.

### Relationships
Sora: Her everything and her nothing, her reason for living. It's possible Shiro needs some intense therapy.

Lucille Johnson: After running away from the bank in a panic, Lucille not only picked Shiro up but also picked up Sora and ensured his recovery. Shiro is extremely grateful because of this and is happily indebted to him.
